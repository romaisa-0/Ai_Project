# Ai_Project
This repository contains a complete pipeline for building, training, and deploying a digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, backend integration using Flask, and a simple UI for testing the model with custom input images.

Repository Structure
dataset/: Contains the MNIST dataset used for training and testing the model.
train.py: The main script for training the model. It includes data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation logic.
app.py: A Flask backend to serve the trained model. It accepts image inputs from the UI, processes them, and returns predictions.
templates/:
Contains the index.html file, which serves as the user interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.
static/:
Includes CSS, JavaScript, and images required for the UI.
custom_images/: Contains example input images drawn in Paint to test the model's performance.
Features
1. Model Training (train.py)
Dataset: The MNIST dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and split into training, validation, and test sets.
Architecture:
Input Layer: 784 neurons (28x28 grayscale image).
Hidden Layer: Fully connected with Sigmoid activation.
Output Layer: 10 neurons (digits 0-9) with Softmax activation for classification.
Training Process:
Uses backpropagation and gradient descent for optimizing the model.
Tracks training, validation, and test accuracy/loss after each epoch.
Model Evaluation: Metrics include accuracy and loss on validation and test datasets.
2. Backend (app.py)
Built using Flask to handle HTTP requests.
Provides an endpoint to process uploaded images and return predictions from the trained model.
Implements image preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the trained model (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization, and adding a bias term).
3. User Interface (index.html)
Allows users to upload custom images drawn in Paint or any other tool.
Displays the predicted digit and the probability scores.
Simple and intuitive design using HTML and CSS.
4. Example Images
Custom images drawn in Paint are included in the repository for testing.
Users can upload these or draw their own images for predictions.
How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-recognition.git  
cd mnist-digit-recognition  
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment. Then install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
3. Train the Model
Run the train.py script to preprocess the dataset and train the model:

python train.py  
The trained weights will be saved in the project directory.

4. Start the Flask Application
Launch the Flask backend to serve predictions:

python app.py  
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000/.

5. Test the Model Using the UI
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/.
Upload an image to test the model. You can use the provided custom_images/ or draw your own images.
View the predicted digit and the corresponding probability scores.
